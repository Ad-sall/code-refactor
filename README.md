# code-refactor

##Description
The code refactor challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means I'll begin with starter code to modify.It's a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 
This project gave me the opportunity to hone my new front-end and junior developer skills by reworking existing code to match a set of standards or implementing new technology.


##Installation
N/A

##Usage
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.
